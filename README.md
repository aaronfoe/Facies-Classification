# Facies-Classification
SVM facies classifier using boreholes 

Using 5 features from borehole logs, the lithological facies are predicted using a Support Vector Machine. This notebook was created within the 'Machine Learning' course from the [Institute for Computational Geoscience and Reservoir Engineering at the RWTH Aachen](https://github.com/cgre-aachen), in particular Mohammad Moulaeifard, [Jan von Harten](https://github.com/javoha) and [Florian Wellmann](https://github.com/flohorovicic), who provided the theoretical basics as well a great starting point for the implementation including some functions. My work was mainly the data processing and training, as well as writing the grid-search function searching for the optimal hyperparameters.

Based on the Jupyter Notebook to the paper "[Facies classification using machine learning](https://library.seg.org/doi/pdf/10.1190/tle35100906.1)" by [Brendon Hall](http://blog.enthought.com/author/bhall/)
